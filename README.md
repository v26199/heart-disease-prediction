# Heart Disease Prediction 

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is primarily for learning and experimentation in the field of machine learning. The project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related factors. By developing a predictive model, we aim to gain insights into different classification algorithms, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and explore techniques for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following main steps:

1. Data Collection: We gather a dataset containing information about individuals, including their age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes, along with the presence or absence of heart disease.

2. Data Preprocessing: We preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

3. Model Development: We experiment with various classification algorithms to build predictive models for heart disease classification. This includes traditional algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, as well as ensemble methods like Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

4. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This allows us to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting heart disease and identify the top-performing models.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: We further optimize the performance of selected models by tuning their hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search Cross-Validation. This helps in fine-tuning the models for better predictive accuracy.

6. Conclusion: Based on the evaluation results, we draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of different classification models for heart disease prediction. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and provide insights into selecting the most suitable model for real-world applications.
